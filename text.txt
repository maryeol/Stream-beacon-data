1/  initilize 3 device points  ; coordinate 0,0
2/  initilize array of 3 
3/ fill the array D
4/ create 3 circles : center = device points , r = distance calculated D[i]
5/ while true : you should find intersection 
    if no intersection , should increase the circle who has larger r
    find intersection point between the circles
